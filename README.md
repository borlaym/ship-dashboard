# Ship Dashboard

## Run locally

`$ yarn && yarn start`

## Scenario

You can modify the scenario by editing `scenario.json` and following the pattern already present there. You can add new values simply by adding them to the json, specifying a type, value, label etc. Note that I have no error handling; make sure to add each value to each time stamp. Btw the timestamp is in milliseconds. Label should be unique.
